# Chapter 4: Things Mother Never Told You: Under the Programming Interface

Over the last few chapters we've seen that programming has many levels, ranging from the familiar (high-level languages, DOS calls, and the like) to the esoteric (cycle-eaters). In this chapter we're going to jump right in at the lowest level by examining the cycle-eaters that live beneath the programming interface.

Why start at the lowest level? Simply because cycle-eaters affect the performance of all assembler code, and yet are almost unknown to most programmers. A full understanding of virtually everything else we'll discuss in *The Zen of Assembly Language* requires an understanding of cycle-eaters and their implications. That's no simple task, and in fact it is in precisely that area that most books and articles about assembler programming fall short.

Nearly all literature on assembler programming discusses only the programming interface: the instruction set, the registers, the flags, and the BIOS and DOS calls. Those topics cover the functionality of assembler programs most thoroughly—but it's performance above all else that we're after. No one ever tells you about the raw stuff of performance, which lies *beneath* the programming interface, in the dimly-seen realm-populated by instruction prefetching, dynamic RAM refresh, and wait states—where software meets hardware. This area is the domain of hardware engineers, and is almost never discussed as it relates to code performance. And yet it is only by understanding the mechanisms operating at this level that we can fully understand and properly improve the performance of our code.

Which brings us to cycle-eaters.

## Cycle-Eaters Revisited

You'll recall that cycle-eaters are gremlins that live on the bus or in peripherals, slowing the performance of 8088 code so that it doesn't execute at full speed. Because cycle-eaters live outside the Execution Unit of the 8088, they can *only* affect the 8088 when the 8088 performs a bus access (a memory or I/O read or write). Internally, the 8088 is a 16-bit processor, capable of running at full speed at all times—unless external data is required. External data must traverse the 8088's external data bus and the PC's data bus 1 byte at a time to and from peripherals, with cycle-eaters lurking along every step of the way. What's more, external data includes not only memory operands *but also instruction bytes*, so even instructions with no memory operands can suffer from cycle-eaters. Since some of the 8088's fastest instructions are register-only instructions, that's important indeed.

The major cycle-eaters are:

  * The 8088's 8-bit external data bus.
  * The prefetch queue.
  * Dynamic RAM refresh.
  * Wait states, notably display memory wait states and, in the AT and 80386 computers, system memory wait states.

The locations of these cycle-eaters in the PC are shown in Figure 4.1. We'll cover each of the cycle-eaters in turn in this chapter. The material won't be easy, since cycle-eaters are among the most subtle aspects of assembler programming. By the same token, however, this will be one of the most important and rewarding chapters in this book. Don't worry if you don't catch everything in this chapter, but do read it all even if the going gets a bit tough. Cycle-eaters play a key role in later chapters, so some familiarity with them is highly desirable. Then, too, those later chapters illustrate cycle-eaters in action, which should help clear up any aspects of cycle-eaters about which you're uncertain.

## The 8-Bit Bus Cycle-Eater

*Look! Down on the motherboard! It's a 16-bit processor! It's an 8-bit processor! It's...*

*...an 8088!*

Fans of the 8088 call it a 16-bit processor. Fans of other 16-bit processors call the 8088 an 8-bit processor. Unbiased as we are, we know that the truth of the matter is that the 8088 is a 16-bit processor that often *performs* like an 8-bit processor.

As we saw in Chapter 3, the 8088 is internally a full 16-bit processor, equivalent to an 8086. In terms of the instruction set, the 8088 is clearly a 16-bit processor, capable of performing any given 16-bit operation—addition, subtraction, even multiplication or division—with a single instruction. Externally, however, the 8088 is unequivocally an 8-bit processor, since the external data bus is only 8 bits wide. In other words, the programming interface is 16 bits wide, but the hardware interface is only 8 bits wide, as shown in Figure 4.2. The result of this mismatch is simple: word-sized data can be transferred between the 8088 and memory or peripherals at only one-half the maximum rate of the 8086, which is to say one-half the maximum rate for which the Execution Unit of the 8088 was designed.

![**Figure 4.2** Internally the 8088 is a 16-bit microprocessor, but externally the 8088 is only an 8-bit microprocessor.](../images/fig4.2RT.png)

As shown in Figure 4.1, the 8-bit bus cycle-eater lies squarely on the 8088's external data bus. Technically, it might be more accurate to place this cycle-eater in the Bus Interface Unit, which breaks 16-bit memory accesses into paired 8-bit accesses, but it is really the limited width of the external data bus that constricts data flow into and out of the 8088. True, the PC's bus is also only 8 bits wide, but that's just to match the 8088's 8-bit bus; even if the PC's bus were 16 bits wide, data could still pass into and out of the 8088 only 1 byte at a time.

Each bus access by the 8088 takes 4 clock cycles, or 0.838 us in the PC, and transfers 1 byte. That means that the maximum rate at which data can be transferred into and out of the 8088 is 1 byte every 0.838 us. While 8086 bus accesses also take 4 clock cycles, each 8086 bus access can transfer either 1 byte or 1 word, for a maximum transfer rate of 1 *word* every 0.838 us. Consequently, for word-sized memory accesses the 8086 has an effective transfer rate of 1 byte every 0.419 us. By contrast, every word-sized access on the 8088 requires two 4-cycle-long bus accesses, one for the high byte of the word and one for the low byte of the word. As a result, the 8088 has an effective transfer rate for word-sized memory accesses of just 1 word every 1.676 us—and that, in a nutshell, is the 8-bit bus cycle-eater.

### The Impact of the 8-Bit Bus Cycle-Eater

One obvious effect of the 8-bit bus cycle-eater is that word-sized accesses to memory operands on the 8088 take 4 cycles longer than byte-sized accesses. That's why the instruction timings in Appendix A indicate that for code running on an 8088 an additional 4 cycles are required for every word-sized access to a memory operand. For instance:

```nasm
mov ax,word ptr [MemVar]
```

takes 4 cycles longer to read the word at address `MemVar`{.nasm} than:

```nasm
mov al,byte ptr [MemVar]
```

takes to read the byte at address `MemVar`{.nasm}. (Actually, the difference between the two isn't very likely to be exactly 4 cycles, for reasons that will become clear when we discuss the prefetch queue and dynamic RAM refresh cycle-eaters later in this chapter.)

What's more, in some cases one instruction can perform multiple word-sized accesses, incurring that 4-cycle penalty on each access. For example, adding a value to a word-sized memory variable requires 2 word-sized accesses—one to read the destination operand from memory prior to adding to it, and one to write the result of the addition back to the destination operand—and thus incurs not one but two 4-cycle penalties. As a result:

```nasm
add word ptr [MemVar],ax
```

takes about 8 cycles longer to execute than:

```nasm
add byte ptr [MemVar],al
```

String instructions can suffer from the 8-bit bus cycle-eater to a greater extent than other instructions. Believe it or not, a single `rep movsw`{.nasm} instruction can lose as much as:

**524,280 cycles = 131,070 word-sized memory accesses x 4 cycles**

to the 8-bit bus cycle-eater! In other words, one 8088 instruction (admittedly, an instruction that does a great deal) can take over one-tenth of a second longer on an 8088 than on an 8086, simply because of the 8-bit bus. *One-tenth of a second!* That's a phenomenally long time in computer terms; in one-tenth of a second, the 8088 can perform more than 50,000 additions and subtractions.

The upshot of all this is simply that the 8088 can transfer word-sized data to and from memory at only half the speed of the 8086, which inevitably causes performance problems when coupled with an Execution Unit that can process word-sized data every bit as fast as an 8086. These problems show up with any code that uses word-sized memory operands. More ominously, as we will see shortly, the 8-bit bus cycle-eater can cause performance problems with other sorts of code as well.

### What to Do About the 8-Bit Bus Cycle-Eater?

The obvious implication of the 8-bit bus cycle-eater is that byte-sized memory variables should be used whenever possible. After all, the 8088 performs *byte-sized* memory accesses just as quickly as the 8086. For instance, [Listing 4-1](#listing-4-1), which uses a byte-sized memory variable as a loop counter, runs in 10.03 us per loop. That's 20% faster than the 12.05 us per loop execution time of [Listing 4-2](#listing-4-2), which uses a word-sized counter. Why the difference in execution times? Simply because each word-sized `dec`{.nasm} performs 4 byte-sized memory accesses (2 to read the word-sized operand and 2 to write the result back to memory), while each byte-sized `dec`{.nasm} performs only 2 byte-sized memory accesses in all.

I'd like to make a brief aside concerning code optimization in the listings in this book. Throughout this book I've modeled the sample code after working code so that the timing results are applicable to real-world programming. In [Listings 4-1](#listing-4-1) and [4-2](#listing-4-2), for instance, I could have shown a still greater advantage for byte-sized operands simply by performing 1000 `dec`{.nasm} instructions in a row, with no branching at all. However, `dec`{.nasm} instructions don't exist in a vacuum, so in the listings I used code that both decremented the counter and tested the result. The difference is that between decrementing a memory location (simply an instruction) and using a loop counter (a functional instruction sequence). If you come across code in *The Zen of Assembly Language* that seems less than optimal, my desire to provide code that's relevant to real programming problems may be the reason. On the other hand, optimal code is an elusive thing indeed; by no means should you assume that the code in this book is ideal! Examine it, question it, and improve upon it, for an inquisitive, skeptical mind is an important part of the Zen of assembler.

Back to the 8-bit bus cycle-eater. As I've said, you should strive to use byte-sized memory variables whenever possible. That does *not* mean that you should use 2 byte-sized memory accesses to manipulate a word-sized memory variable in preference to 1 word-sized memory access, as, for instance, with:

```nasm
mov dl,byte ptr [MemVar]
mov dh,byte ptr [MemVar+1]
```

versus:

```nasm
mov dx,word ptr [MemVar]
```

Recall that every access to a memory byte takes at least 4 cycles; that limitation is built right into the 8088. The 8088 is also built so that the second byte-sized memory access to a 16-bit memory variable takes just those 4 cycles and no more. There's no way you can manipulate the second byte of a word-sized memory variable faster with a second separate byte-sized instruction in less than 4 cycles. As a matter of fact, you're bound to access that second byte much more slowly with a separate instruction, thanks to the overhead of instruction fetching and execution, address calculation, and the like.

For example, consider [Listing 4-3](#listing-4-3), which performs 1000 word-sized reads from memory. This code runs in 3.77 us per word read. That's 45% faster than the 5.49 us per word read of [Listing 4-4](#listing-4-4), which reads the same 1000 words as [Listing 4-3](#listing-4-3) but does so with 2000 byte-sized reads. Both listings perform exactly the same number of memory accesses—2000 accesses, each byte-sized, as all 8088 memory accesses must be. (Remember that the Bus Interface Unit must perform two byte-sized memory accesses in order to handle a word-sized memory operand.) However, [Listing 4-3](#listing-4-3) is considerably faster because it expends only 4 additional cycles to read the second byte of each word, while [Listing 4-4](#listing-4-4) performs a second `lodsb`{.nasm}, requiring 13 cycles, to read the second byte of each word.

In short, if you must perform a 16-bit memory access, let the 8088 break the access into two byte-sized accesses for you. The 8088 is more efficient at that task than your code can possibly be.

Chapter 9 has further examples of ways in which you can take advantage of the 8088's relative speed at handling the second byte of a word-sized memory operand to improve your code. However, that advantage only exists relative to the time taken to access 2 byte-sized memory operands; you're still better off using single byte-sized memory accesses rather than word-sized accesses whenever possible. Word-sized variables should be stored in registers to the greatest feasible extent, since registers are inside the 8088, where 16-bit operations are just as fast as 8-bit operations because the 8-bit cycle-eater can't get at them. In fact, it's a good idea to keep as many variables of all sorts in registers as you can. Instructions with register-only operands execute very rapidly, partially because they avoid both the time-consuming memory accesses and the lengthy address calculations associated with memory operands.

There is yet another reason why register operands are preferable to memory operands, and it's an unexpected effect of the 8-bit bus cycle-eater. Instructions with only register operands tend to be shorter (in terms of bytes) than instructions with memory operands, and when it comes to performance, shorter is usually better. In order to explain why that is true and how it relates to the 8-bit bus cycle-eater, I must diverge for a moment.

For the last few pages, you may well have been thinking that the 8-bit bus cycle-eater, while a nuisance, doesn't seem particularly subtle or difficult to quantify. After all, Appendix A tells us exactly how many cycles each instruction loses to the 8-bit bus cycle-eater, doesn't it?

Yes and no. It's true that in general we know approximately how much longer a given instruction will take to execute with a word-sized memory operand than with a byte-sized operand, although the dynamic RAM refresh and wait state cycle-eaters can raise the cost of the 8-bit bus cycle-eater considerably, as we'll see later in this chapter. However, *all* word-sized memory accesses lose 4 cycles to the 8-bit bus cycle-eater, and there's one sort of word-sized memory access we haven't discussed yet: instruction fetching. The ugliest manifestation of the 8-bit bus cycle-eater is in fact the prefetch queue cycle-eater.

## The Prefetch Queue Cycle-Eater

Simply put, here's the prefetch queue cycle-eater: the 8088's 8-bit external data bus keeps the Bus Interface Unit from fetching instruction bytes as fast as the 16-bit Execution Unit can execute them, so the Execution Unit often lies idle while waiting for the next instruction byte to be fetched.

Exactly why does this happen? Recall that the 8088 is an 8086 internally, but accesses word-sized memory data at only one-half the maximum rate of the 8086 due to the 8088's 8-bit external data bus. Unfortunately, instructions are among the word-sized data the 8086 fetches, meaning that the 8088 can fetch instructions at only one-half the speed of the 8086. On the other hand, the 8086-equivalent Execution Unit of the 8088 can *execute* instructions every bit as fast as the 8086. The net result is that the Execution Unit burns up instruction bytes much faster than the Bus Interface Unit can fetch them, and ends up idling while waiting for instructions bytes to arrive.

The BIU can fetch instruction bytes at a maximum rate of one byte every 4 cycles-*and that 4-cycle per instruction byte rate is the ultimate limit on overall instruction execution time, regardless of EU speed*. While the EU may execute a given instruction that's already in the prefetch queue in less than 4 cycles per byte, over time the EU can't execute instructions any faster than they can arrive-and they can't arrive faster than 1 byte every 4 cycles.

Clearly, then, the prefetch queue cycle-eater is nothing more than one aspect of the 8-bit bus cycle-eater. 8088 code often runs at less than the Execution Unit's maximum speed because the 8-bit data bus can't keep up with the demand for instruction bytes. That's straightforward enough-so why all the fuss about the prefetch queue cycle-eater?

What makes the prefetch queue cycle-eater tricky is that it's undocumented and unpredictable. That is, with a word-sized memory access, such as:

```nasm
mov [bx],ax
```

it's well-documented that an extra 4 cycles will always be required to write the upper byte of AX to memory. Not so with the prefetch queue. For instance, the instructions:

```nasm
shr ax,1
shr ax,1
shr ax,1
shr ax,1
shr ax,1
```

should execute in 10 cycles, according to the specifications in Appendix A, since each `shr`{.nasm} takes 2 cycles to execute. Those specifications contain Intel's official instruction execution times, but in this case-and in many others-the specifications are drastically wrong. Why? Because they describe execution time *once an instruction reaches the prefetch queue*. They say nothing about whether a given instruction will be in the prefetch queue when it's time for that instruction to run, or how long it will take that instruction to reach the prefetch queue if it's not there already. Thanks to the low performance of the 8088's external data bus, that's a glaring omission -but, alas, an unavoidable one. Let's look at why the official execution times are wrong, and why that can't be helped.

### Official Execution Times are Only Part of the Story

The sequence of 5 `shr`{.nasm} instructions in the last example is 10 bytes long. That means that it can never execute in less than 24 cycles even if the 4-byte prefetch queue is full when it starts, since 6 instruction bytes would still remain to be fetched, at 4 cycles per fetch. If the prefetch queue is empty at the start, the sequence *could* take 40 cycles. In short, thanks to instruction fetching the code won't run at its documented speed, and could take up to 4 times as long as it is supposed to.

Why does Intel document Execution Unit execution time rather than overall instruction execution time, which includes both instruction fetch time and Execution Unit execution time? As described in Chapter 3, instruction fetching isn't performed as part of instruction execution by the Execution Unit, but instead is carried on in parallel by the Bus Interface Unit whenever the external data bus isn't in use or whenever the EU runs out of instruction bytes to execute. Sometimes the BIU is able to use spare bus cycles to prefetch instruction bytes before the EU needs them, so instruction fetching takes no time at all, practically speaking. At other times the EU executes instructions faster than the BIU can fetch them and instruction fetching becomes a significant part of overall execution time. As a result, *the effective fetch time for a given instruction varies greatly depending on the code mix preceding that instruction*. Similarly, the state in which a given instruction leaves the prefetch queue affects the overall execution time of the following instructions.

In other words, while the execution time for a given instruction is constant, the fetch time for that instruction depends on the context in which the instruction is executing -the amount of prefetching the preceding instructions allowed -and can vary from a full 4 cycles per instruction byte to no time at all. As we'll see later, other cycle-eaters, such as DRAM refresh and display memory wait states, can cause prefetching variations even during different executions of the *same* code sequence. Given that, it's meaningless to talk about the prefetch time of a given instruction except in the context of a specific code sequence.

So now you know why the official instruction execution times are often wrong, and why Intel can't provide better specifications. You also know now why it is that you must time your code if you want to know how fast it really is.


### There is No Such Beast as a True Instruction Execution Time

The effect of the code preceding an instruction on the execution time of that instruction makes the Zen timer trickier to use than you might expect, and complicates the interpretation of the results reported by the Zen timer. For one thing, the Zen timer is best used to time code sequences that are more than a few instructions long; below 10 us or so, prefetch queue effects and the limited resolution of the clock driving the timer can cause problems.

Some slight prefetch queue-induced inaccuracy usually exists even when the Zen timer is used to time longer code sequences, since the calls to the Zen timer usually alter the code's prefetch queue from its normal state. (As we'll see in Chapter 12, branches—jumps, calls, returns and the like—empty the prefetch queue.) Ideally, the Zen timer is used to measure the performance of an entire subroutine, so the prefetch queue effects of the branches at the start and end of the subroutine are similar to the effects of the calls to the Zen timer when you're measuring the subroutine's performance.

Another way in which the prefetch queue cycle-eater complicates the use of the Zen timer involves the practice of timing the performance of a few instructions over and over. I'll often repeat one or two instructions 100 or 1000 times in a row in listings in this book in order to get timing intervals that are long enough to provide reliable measurements. However, as we just learned, the actual performance of any 8088 instruction depends on the code mix preceding any given use of that instruction, which in turns affects the state of the prefetch queue when the instruction starts executing. Alas, the execution time of an instruction preceded by dozens of identical instructions reflects just one of many possible prefetch states (and not a very likely state at that), and some of the other prefetch states may well produce distinctly different results.

For example, consider the code in [Listings 4-5](#listing-4-5) and [4-6](#listing-4-6). [Listing 4-5](#listing-4-5) shows our familiar `shr`{.nasm} case. Here, because the prefetch queue is always empty, execution time should work out to about 4 cycles per byte, or 8 cycles per `shr`{.nasm}, as shown in Figure 4.3. (Figure 4.3 illustrates the relationship between instruction fetching and execution in a simplified way, and is not intended to show the exact timings of 8088 operations.) That's quite a contrast to the official 2-cycle execution time of `shr`{.nasm}. In fact, the Zen timer reports that [Listing 4-5](#listing-4-5) executes in 1.81 us per byte, or slightly *more* than 4 cycles per byte. (The extra time is the result of the dynamic RAM refresh cycle-eater, which we'll discuss shortly.) Going strictly by [Listing 4-5](#listing-4-5), we would conclude that the "true" execution time of `shr`{.nasm} is 8.64 cycles.

![**Figure 4.3**](../images/fig4.3RT.png)

Now let's examine [Listing 4-6](#listing-4-6). Here each `shr`{.nasm} follows a `mul`{.nasm} instruction. Since `mul`{.nasm} instructions take so long to execute that the prefetch queue is always full when they finish, each `shr`{.nasm} should be ready and waiting in the prefetch queue when the preceding `mul`{.nasm} ends. As a result, we'd expect that each `shr`{.nasm} would execute in 2 cycles; together with the 118 cycle execution time of multiplying 0 times 0, the total execution time should come to 120 cycles per `shr`{.nasm}/`mul`{.nasm} pair, as shown in Figure 4.4. And, by God, when we run [Listing 4-6](#listing-4-6) we get an execution time of 25.14 us per `shr`{.nasm}/`mul`{.nasm} pair, or *exactly* 120 cycles! According to these results, the "true" execution time of `shr`{.nasm} would seem to be 2 cycles, quite a change from the conclusion we drew from [Listing 4-5](#listing-4-5).

![**Figure 4.4** Execution unit time determines the overall execution time of a sequence of slow instructions, such as `mul`{.nasm}, because such a sequence allows the prefetch queue to stay well stocked with instruction bytes in this example. Overall execution time exactly matches execution unit execution time, and the prefetch queue cycle eater has no effect. This figure is for illustrative purposes only, and is not intended to show the exect timings of 8088 operations.](../images/fig4.4RT.png)

The key point is this: we've seen one code sequence in which `shr`{.nasm} took 8-plus cycles to execute, and another in which it took only 2 cycles. Are we talking about two different forms of `shr`{.nasm} here? Of course not—the difference is purely a reflection of the differing states in which the preceding code left the prefetch queue. In [Listing 4-5](#listing-4-5), each `shr`{.nasm} after the first few follows a slew of other `shr`{.nasm} instructions which have sucked the prefetch queue dry, so overall performance reflects instruction fetch time. By contrast, each `shr`{.nasm} in [Listing 4-6](#listing-4-6) follows a `mul`{.nasm} instruction which leaves the prefetch queue full, so overall performance reflects Execution Unit execution time.

Clearly, either instruction fetch time *or* Execution Unit execution time—or even a mix of the two, if an instruction is partially prefetched—can determine code performance. Some people operate under a rule of thumb by which they assume that the execution time of each instruction is 4 cycles times the number of bytes in the instruction. While that's often true for register-only code, it frequently doesn't hold for code that accesses memory. For one thing, the rule should be 4 cycles times the number of *memory accesses*, not instruction bytes, since all accesses take 4 cycles. For another, memory-accessing instructions often have slower Execution Unit execution times than the 4 cycles per memory access rule would dictate, because the 8088 isn't very fast at calculating memory addresses, as we'll see in Chapter 7. Also, the 4 cycles per instruction byte rule isn't true for register-only instructions that are already in the prefetch queue when the preceding instruction ends.

The truth is that it never hurts performance to reduce either the cycle count or the byte count of a given bit of code, but there's no guarantee that one or the other will improve performance either. For example, consider [Listing 4-7](#listing-4-7), which consists of a series of 4-cycle, 2-byte `mov al,0`{.nasm} instructions, and which executes at the rate of 1.81 us per instruction. Now consider [Listing 4-8](#listing-4-8), which replaces the 4-cycle `mov al,0`{.nasm} with the 3-cycle (but still 2-byte) `sub al,al`{.nasm}. Despite its 1-cycle-per-instruction advantage, [Listing 4-8](#listing-4-8) runs at exactly the same speed as [Listing 4-7](#listing-4-7). The reason: both instructions are 2 bytes long, and in both cases it is the 8-cycle instruction fetch time, not the 3-or 4-cycle Execution Unit execution time, that limits performance.

As you can see, it's easy to be drawn into thinking you're saving cycles when you're not. You can only improve the performance of a specific bit of code by reducing the factor - either instruction fetch time or execution time, or sometimes a mix of the two—that's limiting the performance of that code.

In case you missed it in all the excitement, the variability of prefetching means that our method of testing performance by executing 1000 instructions in a row by no means produces "true" instruction execution times, any more than the official execution times in Appendix A are "true" times. The fact of the matter is that a given instruction takes at least as long to execute as the time given for it in Appendix A, but may take as much as 4 cycles per byte longer, depending on the state of the prefetch queue when the preceding instruction ends. The only true execution time for an instruction is a time measured in a certain context, and that time is meaningful *only* in that context.

Look at it this way. We've firmly established that there's no number you can attach to a given instruction that's always that instruction's true execution time. In fact, as we'll see in the rest of this chapter and in the next, there are other cycle-eaters that can work with the prefetch queue cycle-eater to cause the execution time of an instruction to vary to an even greater extent than we've seen so far. That's okay, though, because the execution time of a single instruction is not what we're really after.

What we *really* want is to know how long useful working code takes to run, not how long a single instruction takes, and the Zen timer gives us the tool we need to gather that information. Granted, it would be easier if we could just add up neatly documented instruction execution times—but that's not going to happen. Without actually measuring the performance of a given code sequence, you simply don't know how fast it is. For crying out loud, even the people who *designed* the 8088 at Intel couldn't tell you exactly how quickly a given 8088 code sequence executes on the PC just by looking at it! Get used to the idea that execution times are only meaningful in context, learn the rules of thumb in this book, and use the Zen timer to measure your code.

### Approximating Overall Execution Times

Don't think that because overall instruction execution time is determined by both instruction fetch time and Execution Unit execution time, the two times should be added together when estimating performance. For example, practically speaking, each `shr`{.nasm} in [Listing 4-5](#listing-4-5) does not take 8 cycles of instruction fetch time plus 2 cycles of Execution Unit execution time to execute. Figure 4.3 shows that while a given `shr`{.nasm} is executing, the fetch of the next `shr`{.nasm}is starting, and since the two operations are overlapped for 2 cycles, there's no sense in charging the time to both instructions. You could think of the extra instruction fetch time for `shr`{.nasm} in [Listing 4-5](#listing-4-5) as being 6 cycles, which yields an overall execution time of 8 cycles when added to the 2 cycles of Execution Unit execution time.

Alternatively, you could think of each `shr`{.nasm} in [Listing 4-5](#listing-4-5) as taking 8 cycles to fetch, and then executing in effectively 0 cycles while the next `shr`{.nasm} is being fetched. Whichever perspective you prefer is fine. The important point is that the time during which the execution of one instruction and the fetching of the next instruction overlap should only be counted toward the overall execution time of one of the instructions. For all intents and purposes, one of the two instructions runs at no performance cost whatsoever while the overlap exists.

As a working definition, we'll consider the execution time of a given instruction in a particular context to start when the first byte of the instruction is sent to the Execution Unit and end when the first byte of the next instruction is sent to the EU. We'll discuss this further in Chapter 5.

### What to Do About the Prefetch Queue Cycle-Eater?

Reducing the impact of the prefetch queue cycle-eater is one of the overriding principles of high-performance assembler code. How can you do this? One effective technique is to minimize access to memory operands, since such accesses compete with instruction fetching for precious memory accesses. You can also greatly reduce instruction fetch time simply by your choice of instructions: *keep your instructions short*. Less time is required to fetch instructions that are 1 or 2 bytes long than instructions that are 5 or 6 bytes long. Reduced instruction fetching lowers minimum execution time (minimum execution time is 4 cycles times the number of instruction bytes) and often leads to faster overall execution.

While short instructions minimize overall prefetch time, they ironically actually often suffer relatively more from the prefetch queue bottleneck than do long instructions. Short instructions generally have such fast execution times that they drain the prefetch queue despite their small size. For example, consider the `shr`{.nasm} of [Listing 4-5](#listing-4-5), which runs at only 25% of its Execution Unit execution time even though it's only 2 bytes long, thanks to the prefetch queue bottleneck. Short instructions are nonetheless generally faster than long instructions, thanks to the combination of fewer instruction bytes and faster Execution Unit execution times, and should be used as much as possible—just don't expect them to run at their documented speeds.

More than anything, the above rules mean using the registers as heavily as possible, both because register-only instructions are short and because they don't perform memory accesses to read or write operands. (Using the registers is a topic we'll return to repeatedly in *The Zen of Assembly Language*.) However, using the registers is a rule of thumb, not a commandment. In some circumstances, it may actually be *faster* to access memory. (The look-up table technique, which we'll encounter in Chapter 7, is one such case.) What's more, the performance of the prefetch queue (and hence the performance of each instruction) differs from one code sequence to the next, and can even differ during different executions of the same code sequence.

All in all, writing good assembler code is as much an art as a science. As a result, you should follow the rules of thumb described in *The Zen of Assembly Language*—and then time your code to see how fast it really is. You should experiment freely, but always remember that actual, measured performance is the bottom line.

The prefetch queue cycle-eater looms over the performance of all 8088 code. We'll encounter it again and again in this book, and in every case it will make our code slower than it would otherwise be. An understanding of the prefetch queue cycle-eater provides deep insight into what makes some 8088 code much faster than other, seemingly similar 8088 code, and is a key to good assembler programming. You'll never conquer this cycle-eater, but with experience and the Zen timer you can surely gain the advantage.

### Holding Up the 8088

Over the last two chapters I've taken you further and further into the depths of the PC, telling you again and again that you must understand the computer at the lowest possible level in order to write good code. At this point, you may well wonder, "Have we gotten low enough?"

Not quite yet. The 8-bit bus and prefetch queue cycle-eaters are low-level indeed, but we've one level yet to go. Dynamic RAM refresh and wait states—our next topics—together form the lowest level at which the hardware of the PC affects code performance. Below this level, the PC is of interest only to hardware engineers.

Before we begin our discussion of dynamic RAM refresh, let's step back for a moment to take an overall look at this lowest level of cycle-eaters. In truth, the distinctions between wait states and dynamic RAM refresh don't much matter to a programmer. What is important is that you understand this: *under certain circumstances devices on the PC bus can stop the 8088 for 1 or more cycles, making your code run more slowly than it seemingly should*.

Unlike all the cycle-eaters we've encountered so far, wait states and dynamic RAM refresh are strictly external to the 8088, as shown in Figure 4.1. Adapters on the PC's bus, such as video and memory cards, can insert wait states on any 8088 bus access, the idea being that they won't be able to complete the access properly unless the access is stretched out. Likewise, the channel of the DMA controller dedicated to dynamic RAM refresh can request control of the bus at any time, although the 8088 must relinquish the bus before the DMA controller can take over. This means that your code can't directly control wait states or dynamic RAM refresh. However, code *can* sometimes be designed to minimize the effects of these cycle-eaters, and even when the cycle-eaters slow your code without there being a thing in the world you can do about it, you're still better off understanding that you're losing performance and knowing why your code doesn't run as fast as it's supposed to than you were programming in ignorance.

Let's start with DRAM refresh, which affects the performance of every program that runs on the PC.

## Dynamic Ram Refresh: The Invisible Hand

Dynamic RAM (DRAM) refresh is sort of an act of God. By that I mean that DRAM refresh invisibly and inexorably steals up to 8.33% of all available memory access time from your programs. While you *could* stop DRAM refresh, you wouldn't want to, since that would be a sure prescription for crashing your computer. In the end, thanks to DRAM refresh, almost all code runs a bit slower on the PC than it otherwise would, and that's that.

A bit of background: a static RAM (SRAM) chip is a memory chip which retains its contents indefinitely so long as power is maintained. By contrast, each of several blocks of bits in a dynamic RAM (DRAM) chip retains its contents for only a short time after it's accessed for a read or write. In order to get a DRAM chip to store data for an extended period, each of the blocks of bits in that chip must be accessed regularly, so that the chip's stored data is kept refreshed and valid. So long as this is done often enough, a DRAM chip will retain its contents indefinitely.

All of the PC's system memory consists of DRAM chips. (Some PC-compatible computers are built with SRAM chips, but IBM PCs, XTs, and ATs use only DRAM chips for system memory.) Each DRAM chip in the PC must be completely refreshed once every 4 ms (give or take a little) in order to ensure the integrity of the data it stores. Obviously, it's highly desirable that the memory in the PC retain the correct data indefinitely, so each DRAM chip in the PC *must* always be refreshed within 4 ms of the last refresh. Since there's no guarantee that a given program will access each and every DRAM once every 4 ms, the PC contains special circuitry and programming for providing DRAM refresh.

### How Dram Refresh Works in the Pc

Timer 1 of the 8253 timer chip is programmed at power-up to generate a signal once every 72 cycles, or once every 15.08 us. That signal goes to channel 0 of the 8237 DMA controller, which requests the bus from the 8088 upon receiving the signal. (DMA stands for *direct memory access*, the ability of a device other than the 8088 to control the bus and access memory directly, without any help from the 8088.) As soon as the 8088 is between memory accesses, it gives control of the bus to the 8237, which in conjunction with special circuitry on the PC's motherboard then performs a single 4-cycle read access to 1 of 256 possible addresses, advancing to the next address on each successive access. (The read access is only for the purpose of refreshing the DRAM; the data read isn't used.)

The 256 addresses accessed by the refresh DMA accesses are arranged so that taken together they properly refresh all the memory in the PC. By accessing one of the 256 addresses every 15.08 us, all of the PC's DRAM is refreshed in:

**3.86 ms = 256 x 15.08 us**

just about the desired 4 ms time I mentioned earlier. (Only the first 640 Kb of memory is refreshed; video adapters and other adapters above 640 Kb containing memory that requires refreshing must provide their own DRAM refresh.)

Don't sweat the details here. The important point is this: for at least 4 out of every 72 cycles, the PC's bus is given over to DRAM refresh and is not available to the 8088, as shown in Figure 4.5. That means that as much as 5.56% of the PC's already inadequate bus capacity is lost. However, DRAM refresh doesn't necessarily stop the 8088 for 4 cycles. The Execution Unit of the 8088 can keep processing while DRAM refresh is occurring, unless the EU needs to access memory. Consequently, DRAM refresh can slow code performance anywhere from 0% to 5.56% (and actually a bit more, as we'll see shortly), depending on the extent to which DRAM refresh occupies cycles during which the 8088 would otherwise be accessing memory.

![**Figure 4.5** The PC's bus is given over to providing dynamic RAM (DRAM) refresh for at least 4 cycles out of every 72 cycles.](../images/fig4.5RT.png)

### The Impact of Dram Refresh

Let's look at examples from opposite ends of the spectrum in terms of the impact of DRAM refresh on code performance. First, consider the series of `mul`{.nasm} instructions in [Listing 4-9](#listing-4-9). Since a 16-bit `mul`{.nasm} executes in between 118 and 133 cycles and is only 2 bytes long, there should be plenty of time for the prefetch queue to fill after each instruction, even after DRAM refresh has taken its slice of memory access time. Consequently, the prefetch queue should be able to keep the Execution Unit well-supplied with instruction bytes at all times. Since [Listing 4-9](#listing-4-9) uses no memory operands, the Execution Unit should never have to wait for data from memory, and DRAM refresh should have no impact on performance. (Remember that the Execution Unit can operate normally during DRAM refreshes so long as it doesn't need to request a memory access from the Bus Interface Unit.)

Running [Listing 4-9](#listing-4-9), we find that each `mul`{.nasm} executes in 24.72 us, or exactly 118 cycles. Since that's the shortest time in which `mul`{.nasm} can execute, we can see that no performance is lost to DRAM refresh. [Listing 4-9](#listing-4-9) clearly illustrates that DRAM refresh only affects code performance when a DRAM refresh forces the Execution Unit of the 8088 to wait for a memory access.

Now let's look at the series of `shr`{.nasm} instructions shown in [Listing 4-10](#listing-4-10). Since `shr`{.nasm} executes in 2 cycles but is 2 bytes long, the prefetch queue should be empty while [Listing 4-10](#listing-4-10) executes, with the 8088 prefetching instruction bytes non-stop. As a result, the time per instruction of [Listing 4-10](#listing-4-10) should precisely reflect the time required to fetch the instruction bytes.

Since 4 cycles are required to read each instruction byte, we'd expect each `shr`{.nasm} to execute in 8 cycles, or 1.676 us, if there were no DRAM refresh. In fact, each `shr`{.nasm} in [Listing 4-10](#listing-4-10) executes in 1.81 us, indicating that DRAM refresh is taking 7.4% of the program's execution time. That's nearly 2% more than our worst-case estimate of the loss to DRAM refresh overhead! In fact, the result indicates that DRAM refresh is stealing not 4 but 5.33 cycles out of every 72 cycles. How can this be?

The answer is that a given DRAM refresh can actually hold up CPU memory accesses for as many as 6 cycles, depending on the timing of the DRAM refresh's DMA request relative to the 8088's internal instruction execution state. When the code in [Listing 4-10](#listing-4-10) runs, each DRAM refresh holds up the CPU for either 5 or 6 cycles, depending on where the 8088 is in executing the current `shr`{.nasm} instruction when the refresh request occurs. Now we see that things can get even worse than we thought: *DRAM refresh can steal as much as 8.33% of available memory access time*—*6 out of every 72 cycles*—*from the 8088*.

Which of the two cases we've examined reflects reality? While either *can* happen, the latter case—significant performance reduction, ranging as high as 8.33%—is far more likely to occur. This is especially true for high-performance assembler code, which uses fast instructions that tend to cause non-stop instruction fetching.

### What to Do About the Dram Refresh Cycle-Eater?

*Hmmm.* When we discovered the prefetch queue cycle-eater, we learned to use short instructions. When we discovered the 8-bit bus cycle-eater, we learned to use byte-sized memory operands whenever possible, and to keep word-sized variables in registers. What can we do to work around the DRAM refresh cycle-eater?

Nothing.

As I've said before, DRAM refresh is an act of God. DRAM refresh is a fundamental, unchanging part of the PC's operation, and there's nothing you or I can do about it. If refresh were any less frequent, the reliability of the PC would be compromised, so tinkering with either timer 1 or DMA channel 0 to reduce DRAM refresh overhead is out. Nor is there any way to structure code to minimize the impact of DRAM refresh. Sure, some instructions are affected less by DRAM refresh than others, but how many multiplies and divides in a row can you really use? I suppose that code *could* conceivably be structured to leave a free memory access every 72 cycles, so DRAM refresh wouldn't have any effect. In the old days when code size was measured in bytes, not K bytes, and processors were less powerful—and complex—programmers did in fact use similar tricks to eke every last bit of performance from their code. When programming the PC, however, the prefetch queue cycle-eater would make such careful code synchronization a difficult task indeed, and any modest performance improvement that did result could never justify the increase in programming complexity and the limits on creative programming that such an approach would entail. There's no way around it: useful code accesses memory frequently and at irregular intervals, and over the long haul DRAM refresh always exacts its price.

If you're still harboring thoughts of reducing the overhead of DRAM refresh, consider this. Instructions that tend not to suffer very much from DRAM refresh are those that have a high ratio of execution time to instruction fetch time, and those aren't the fastest instructions of the PC. It certainly wouldn't make sense to use slower instructions just to reduce DRAM refresh overhead, for it's *total* execution time—DRAM refresh, instruction fetching, and all—that matters.

The important thing to understand about DRAM refresh is that it generally slows your code down, and that the extent of that performance reduction can vary considerably and unpredictably, depending on how the DRAM refreshes interact with your code's pattern of memory accesses. When you use the Zen timer and get a fractional cycle count for the execution time of an instruction, that's often DRAM refresh at work. (The display adapter cycle-eater is another possible culprit.) Whenever you get two timing results that differ less or more than they seemingly should, that's usually DRAM refresh too. Thanks to DRAM refresh, variations of up to 8.33% in PC code performance are par for the course.

## Wait States

Wait states are cycles during which a bus access by the 8088 to a device on the PC's bus is temporarily halted by that device while the device gets ready to complete the read or write. Wait states are well and truly the lowest level of code performance. Everything we have discussed (and will discuss)—even DMA accesses—can be affected by wait states.

Wait states exist because the 8088 must to be able to coexist with any adapter, no matter how slow (within reason). The 8088 expects to be able to complete each bus access—a memory or I/O read or write—in 4 cycles, but adapters can't always respond that quickly, for a number of reasons. For example, display adapters must split access to display memory between the 8088 and the circuitry that generates the video signal based on the contents of display memory, so they often can't immediately fulfill a request by the 8088 for a display memory read or write. To resolve this conflict, display adapters can tell the 8088 to wait during bus accesses by inserting one or more wait states, as shown in Figure 4.6. The 8088 simply sits and idles as long as wait states are inserted, then completes the access as soon as the display adapter indicates its readiness by no longer inserting wait states. The same would be true of any adapter that couldn't keep up with the 8088.

![**Figure 4.6** Both the video circuitry and the 8088 often try to access display memory at the same time. Display adapters resolve such conflicts by holding up 8088 accesses with wait states until the video circuitry no longer needs to access display memory. This figure is for illustrative purposes only, and is not intended to show the exact timings of 8088 operations.](../images/fig4.6RT.png)

Mind you, this is all transparent to the code running on the 8088. An instruction that encounters wait states runs exactly as if there were no wait states, but slower. Wait states are nothing more or less than wasted time as far as the 8088 and your program are concerned.

By understanding the circumstances in which wait states can occur, you can avoid them when possible. Even when it's not possible to work around wait states, it's still to your advantage to understand how they can cause your code to run more slowly.

First, let's learn a bit more about wait states by contrast with DRAM refresh. Unlike DRAM refresh, wait states do not occur on any regularly scheduled basis, and are of no particular duration. Wait states can only occur when an instruction performs a memory or I/O read or write. Both the presence of wait states and the number of wait states inserted on any given bus access are entirely controlled by the device being accessed. When it comes to wait states, the 8088 is passive, merely accepting whatever wait states the accessed device chooses to insert during the course of the access. All of this makes perfect sense given that the whole point of the wait state mechanism is to allow a device to stretch out any access to itself for however much time it needs to perform the access.

Like DRAM refresh, wait states don't stop the 8088 completely. The Execution Unit can continue processing while wait states are inserted, so long as the EU doesn't need to perform a bus access. However, in the PC wait states most often occur when an instruction accesses a memory operand, so in fact the Execution Unit usually is stopped by wait states. (Instruction fetches rarely wait in a PC because system memory is zero-wait-state. AT memory routinely inserts 1 wait state, however, as we'll see in Chapter 15.)

As it turns out, wait states pose a serious problem in just one area in the PC. While any adapter *can* insert wait states, in the PC only display adapters do so to the extent that performance is seriously affected.

### The Display Adapter Cycle-Eater

Display adapters must serve two masters, and that creates a fundamental performance problem. Master #1 is the circuitry that drives the display screen. This circuitry must constantly read display memory in order to obtain the information used to draw the characters or dots displayed on the screen. Since the screen must be redrawn between 50 and 70 times per second, and since each redraw of the screen can require as many as 36,000 reads of display memory (more in Super-VGA modes), master #1 is a demanding master indeed. No matter how demanding master #1 gets, though, its needs must *always* be met—otherwise the quality of the picture on the screen would suffer.

Master #2 is the 8088, which reads from and writes to display memory in order to manipulate the bytes that the video circuitry reads to form the picture on the screen. Master #2 is less important than master #1, since the 8088 affects display quality only indirectly. In other words, if the video circuitry has to wait for display memory accesses, the picture will develop holes, snow, and the like, but if the 8088 has to wait for display memory accesses, the program will just run a bit slower—no big deal.

It matters a great deal which master is more important, for while both the 8088 and the video circuitry must gain access to display memory, only one of the two masters can read or write display memory at any one time. Potential conflicts are resolved by flat-out guaranteeing the video circuitry however many accesses to display memory it needs, with the 8088 waiting for whatever display memory accesses are left over.

It turns out that the 8088 has to do a lot of waiting, for three reasons. First, the video circuitry can take as much as about 90% of the available display memory access time, as shown in Figure 4.7, leaving as little as about 10% of all display memory accesses for the 8088. (These percentages vary considerably among the many EGA and VGA clones.)

![**Figure 4.7** The video circuitry, which scans display memory for pixel data, can take as much as 90 percent of available display memory access time, leaving as little as about 10 percent of all display memory access free for the use of the 8088.](../images/fig4.7RT.png)

Second, because dots (or *pixels*, short for "picture elements") must be drawn on the screen at a constant speed, display adapters can provide memory accesses only at fixed intervals. As a result, time can be lost while the 8088 synchronizes with the start of the next display adapter memory access, even if the video circuitry isn't accessing display memory at that time, as shown in Figure 4.8.

![**Figure 4.8** Accesses to display memory are available only at fixed intervals and are of fixed lengths. Both the intervals and the lengths are controlled by the display adapter, and are the same regardless of the speed of the computer in which the display adapter is installed. This figure is for illustrative purposes only, and is not intended to show the exact timings of 8088 operations.](../images/fig4.8RT.png)

Finally, the time it takes a display adapter to complete a memory access is related to the speed of the clock which generates pixels on the screen rather than to the memory access speed of the 8088. Consequently, the time taken for display memory to complete an 8088 read or write access is often longer than the time taken for system memory to complete an access, even if the 8088 lucks into hitting a free display memory access just as it becomes available, again as shown in Figure 4.8. Any or all of the three factors I've described can result in wait states, slowing the 8088 and creating the display adapter cycle-eater.

If some of this is Greek to you, don't worry. The important point is that display memory is not very fast compared to normal system memory. How slow is it? *Incredibly* slow. Remember how slow the PC*jr* was? In case you've forgotten, I'll refresh your memory: the PC*jr* was at best only half as fast as the PC. The PC*jr* had an 8088 running at 4.77 MHz, just like the PC—why do you suppose it was so much slower? I'll tell you why: *all the memory in the PC*jr*was display memory.*

Enough said.

All the memory in the PC is *not* display memory, however, and unless you're thickheaded enough to put code in display memory, the PC isn't going to run as slowly as a PCjr. (Putting code or other non-video data in unused areas of display memory sounds like a neat idea—until you consider the effect on instruction prefetching of cutting the 8088's already-poor memory access performance in half. Running your code from display memory is sort of like running on the hypothetical 8084—an 8086 with a *4-bit* bus. Not recommended!) Given that your code and data reside in normal system memory below the 640 K mark, how great an impact does the display adapter cycle-eater have on performance?

The answer varies considerably depending on what display adapter and what display mode we're talking about. The display adapter cycle-eater is worst with the Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA) and the Video Graphics Array (VGA). While the Color/Graphics Adapter (CGA), Monochrome Display Adapter (MDA), and Hercules Graphics Card (HGC) all suffer from the display adapter cycle-eater as well, they suffer to a lesser degree. Since the EGA and particularly the VGA represent the standard for PC graphics now and for the foreseeable future, and since those are the hardest graphics adapter to wring performance from, we'll restrict our discussion to the EGA and VGA for the remainder of this chapter.

### The Impact of the Display Adapter Cycle-Eater

Even on the EGA and VGA, the effect of the display adapter cycle-eater depends on the display mode selected. In text mode, the display adapter cycle-eater is rarely a major factor. It's not that the cycle-eater isn't present; however, a mere 4000 bytes control the entire text mode display, and even with the display adapter cycle-eater it just doesn't take that long to manipulate 4000 bytes. Even if the display adapter cycle-eater were to cause the 8088 to take as much as 5 us per display memory access—more than ten times normal—it would still take only:

**40 ms = 4000 x 2 x 5 us**

to read *and* write every byte of display memory. That's a lot of time as measured in 8088 cycles, but it's less than the blink of an eye in human time, and video performance only matters in human time. After all, the whole point of drawing graphics is to convey visual information, and if that information can be presented faster than the eye can see, that is by definition fast enough.

That's not to say that the display adapter cycle-eater *can't* matter in text mode. In Chapter 2 I recounted the story of a debate among letter-writers to a magazine about exactly how quickly characters could be written to display memory without causing snow. The writers carefully added up Intel's instruction cycle times to see how many writes to display memory they could squeeze into a single horizontal retrace interval. (On a CGA, it's only during the short horizontal retrace interval and the longer vertical retrace interval that display memory can be accessed in 80-column text mode without causing snow.) Of course, now we know that their cardinal sin was to ignore the prefetch queue; even if there were no wait states, their calculations would have been overly optimistic. There *are* display memory wait states as well, however, so the calculations were not just optimistic but wildly optimistic.

Text mode situations such as the above notwithstanding, where the display adapter cycle-eater really kicks in is in graphics mode, and most especially in the high-resolution graphics modes of the EGA and VGA. The problem here is not that there are necessarily more wait states per access in high-resolution graphics modes (that varies from adapter to adapter and mode to mode). Rather, the problem is simply that are many more bytes of display memory per screen in these modes than in lower-resolution graphics modes and in text modes, so many more display memory accesses—each incurring its share of display memory wait states—are required in order to draw an image of a given size. When accessing the many thousands of bytes used in the high-resolution graphics modes, the cumulative effects of display memory wait states can seriously impact code performance, even as measured in human time.

For example, if we assume the same 5 us per display memory access for the EGA's high-res graphics mode that we assumed for text mode, it would take:

**260 ms = 26,000 x 2 x 5 us**

to scroll the screen once in the EGA's hi-res graphics mode, mode 10h. That's more than one-quarter of a second—noticeable by human standards, an eternity by computer standards.

That sounds pretty serious, but we did make an unfounded assumption about memory access speed. Let's get some hard numbers. [Listing 4-11](#listing-4-11) accesses display memory at the 8088's maximum speed, by way of a `rep movsw`{.nasm} with display memory as both source and destination. The code in [Listing 4-11](#listing-4-11) executes in 3.18 us per access to display memory—not as long as we had assumed, but a long time nonetheless.

For comparison, let's see how long the same code takes when accessing normal system RAM instead of display memory. The code in [Listing 4-12](#listing-4-12), which performs a `rep movsw`{.nasm} from the code segment to the code segment, executes in 1.39 us per display memory access. That means that on average 1.79 us (more than 8 cycles!) are lost to the display adapter cycle-eater on each access. In other words, the display adapter cycle-eater can *more than double* the execution time of 8088 code!

Bear in mind that we're talking about a worst case here; the impact of the display adapter cycle-eater is proportional to the percent of time a given code sequence spends accessing display memory. A line-drawing subroutine, which executes perhaps a dozen instructions for each display memory access, generally loses less performance to the display adapter cycle-eater than does a block-copy or scrolling subroutine that uses `rep movs`{.nasm} instructions. Scaled and three-dimensional graphics, which spend a great deal of time performing calculations (often using *very* slow floating-point arithmetic), tend to suffer still less.

In addition, code that accesses display memory infrequently tends to suffer only about half of the maximum display memory wait states, because on average such code will access display memory halfway between one available display memory access slot and the next. As a result, code that accesses display memory less intensively than the code in [Listing 4-11](#listing-4-11) will on average lose 4 or 5 rather than 8-plus cycles to the display adapter cycle-eater on each memory access.

Nonetheless, the display adapter cycle-eater always takes its toll on graphics code. Interestingly, that toll becomes relatively much higher on ATs and 80386 machines, because while those computers can execute many more instructions per microsecond than can the PC, it takes just as long to access display memory on those computers as on the PC. Remember, the limited speed of access to a graphics adapter is an inherent characteristic of the adapter, so the fastest computer around can't access display memory one iota faster than the adapter will allow. We'll discuss this further in Chapter 15.

### What to Do About the Display Adapter Cycle-Eater?

What can we do about the display adapter cycle-eater? Well, we can minimize display memory accesses whenever possible. In particular, we can try to avoid read/modify/write display memory operations of the sort used to mask individual pixels and clip images. Why? Because read/modify/write operations require two display memory accesses (one read and one write) each time display memory is manipulated. Instead, we should try to use writes of the sort that set all the pixels in a given byte of display memory at once, since such writes don't require accompanying read accesses. The key here is that only half as many display memory accesses are required to write a byte to display memory as are required to read a byte from display memory, mask part of it off and alter the rest, and write the byte back to display memory. Half as many display memory accesses means half as many display memory wait states.

Along the same line, the display adapter cycle-eater makes the popular exclusive-or animation technique, which requires paired reads and writes of display memory, less-than-ideal for the PC. Exclusive-or animation should be avoided in favor of simply writing images to display memory whenever possible, as we'll see in Chapter 11.

Another principle for display adapter programming is to perform multiple accesses to display memory very rapidly, in order to make use of as many of the scarce accesses to display memory as possible. This is especially important when many large images need to be drawn quickly, since only by using virtually every available display memory access can many bytes be written to display memory in a short period of time. Repeated string instructions are ideal for making maximum use of display memory accesses; of course, repeated string instructions can only be used on whole bytes, so this is another point in favor of modifying display memory a byte at a time.

These concepts certainly need examples and clarification, along with some working code; that's coming up in Volume II of *The Zen of Assembly Language*. Why not now? Well, in Volume II we'll be able to devote a whole chapter to display adapter programming, and by that point we'll have the benefit of an understanding of the flexible mind, which is certainly a plus for this complex topic.

For now, all you really need to know about the display adapter cycle-eater is that you can lose more than 8 cycles of execution time on each access to display memory. For intensive access to display memory, the loss really can be as high as 8-plus cycles, while for average graphics code the loss is closer to 4 cycles; in either case, the impact on performance is significant. There is only one way to discover just how significant the impact of the display adapter cycle-eater is for any particular graphics code, and that is of course to measure the performance of that code.

If you're interested in the detailed operation of the display adapter cycle-eater, I suggest you read my article, "The Display Adapter Bottleneck," in the January, 1987 issue of *PC Tech Journal*.

## Cycle-Eaters: A Summary

We've covered a great deal of sophisticated material in this chapter, so don't feel bad if you haven't understood everything you've read; it will all become clear as you read on. What's really important is that you come away from this chapter understanding that:

  * The 8-bit bus cycle-eater causes each access to a word-sized operand to be 4 cycles longer than an equivalent access to a byte-sized operand.
  * The prefetch queue cycle-eater can cause instruction execution times to be as much as four times longer than the times specified in Appendix A.
  * The DRAM refresh cycle-eater slows most PC code, with performance reductions ranging as high as 8.33%.
  * The display adapter cycle-eater typically doubles and can more than triple the length of the standard 4-cycle access to display memory, with intensive display memory access suffering most.

This basic knowledge about cycle-eaters puts you in a good position to understand the results reported by the Zen timer, and that means that you're well on your way to writing highperformance assembler code. We will put this knowledge to work throughout the remainder of *The Zen of Assembly Language*.

## What Does It All Mean?

There you have it: life under the programming interface. It's not a particularly pretty picture, for the inhabitants of that strange realm where hardware and software meet are little-known cycle-eaters that sap the speed from your unsuspecting code. Still, some of those cycle-eaters can be minimized by keeping instructions short, using the registers, using byte-sized memory operands, and accessing display memory as little as possible. None of the cycle-eaters can be eliminated, and dynamic RAM refresh can scarcely be addressed at all; still, aren't you better off knowing how fast your code *really* runs—and why—than you were reading the official execution times and guessing?

So far we've only examined cycle-eaters singly. Unfortunately, cycle-eaters don't work alone, and together they're still more complex and unpredictable than they are taken one at a time. The intricate relationship between the cycle-eaters is our next topic.
